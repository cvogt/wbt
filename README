A little experiment writing a web interface to sbt
Its implemented as a sbt-processor using lift, and currently supports:

- browsing your project
- executing available tasks (with autocompletion)
- showing colored output from task execution (live, using comet)
- exit (putting you back into your sbt session)
- reload (if you change the project definition file, sbt needs to reload to pick up the changes)

to install, start sbt and issue the following commands
update
*wbt is wbt processor 0.1

Installed and ready to go, start it by writing wbt in a sbt session.
The web interface will be available at port 9999

enjoy

(it currently uses sbt 0.7.5.RC0, if you use a different version
you need to change the sbt version in build.properties and rebuild it)
